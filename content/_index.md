Smart Prong Technologies, Inc. was founded in 2012 by Michael H. Freeman, J.D. a two-time Emmy award-winning inventor of streaming cellular video technology that became the basis for the IEEE 802.11(n) wireless standard that is still in use today. Licensed by virtually every cell company existing in the 1990â€™s, the streaming technology and patents were ultimately purchased by Samsung, and were asserted in the ***Apple vs. Samsung*** litigation, in which Michael testified, as the first one to combine the intelligence of computers with the connectivity of cellular networks.
