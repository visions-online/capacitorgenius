## Business Biography of Michael Hayes Freeman, J.D.

### Education: 
> Oklahoma State University - Bachelor of Science

> University of Tulsa School of Law - Juris Doctorate

Mr. Freeman has had a wide and varied career including award-winning business ventures, record setting law settlements and commendations from both the federal bench and executive federal agencies for his leadership abilities, acumen, and successes.

Freeman founded Ocutrx Vision Technologies, LLC (now Ocutrx Technologies, Inc.) in 2015 as a result of seeking a way to work-around his father’s macular degeneration and the company got its business start in 2016. Brig. Gen. Richard C. “Dick” Freeman (USAFR) had headed multiple business in addition to being an Air Guard fighter pilot, when in 2013 he developed debilitating Advanced Macular Degeneration (AMD).

The Freeman team of Michael and Mitchael Freeman began researching how to create a device to assist those with AMD. In 2019, the company realized its goal of providing a solution for patients with macular degeneration which permits them to see faces, do tasks and read again. The first clinical trial with the OcuLenz™ AR/XR headsets resulted in improving an AMD patient’s vision from worse than 20/200 to an average of 20/56.

Since then, the Company has grown to multiple uses of the AR/XR headset and has received a coveted one of its kind patents on a Near-Eye Pupil-Forming Catadioptric Optical Engine, which provides a user with cinematic quality and the largest field-of-view in the AR/XR market. Supported by over 40 of the world’s top Retinal Surgeons and Ophthalmologists, the Company moved into developing a full surgical suite in 2020, based on its ORLenz™ Surgery Headset providing 3D visualization and better ergonomics for surgeons, called the OR-Bot Surgery Visualization Theatre™.
Freeman is an award-winning inventor with 76 current patents issued and over 100 patents still pending. Freeman holds patents in seven (7) different scientific disciplines: (i) streaming mobile video; (ii) Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) navigation and localization; (iii) Nano-Chemistry; (iv) Transformerless Power Supplies; (v) Augmented Reality/Extended Reality (AR/XR) Headsets; (vi) Medical Devices; and (vii) FinTech technology.

Adept at the helm of a business, in a courtroom setting, or in conducting one of more than 400 press conferences to date, Mr. Freeman’s talents include strategic planning, organization, implementation and execution as well as revolutionary innovation.

Brig. Gen. Richard C. Freeman

OCULENZ AR/XR HEADSET

While still in high-school, Freeman started working part-time as a Federal Trustee, at the behest of the Federal Court in business bankruptcy cases, and Freeman is believed to be the youngest U.S. Trustee ever appointed. He continued both of these rolls after graduating law-school. Freeman also worked part-time at his father’s Beechcraft® Dealership where he became a pilot and ferried new planes from the factory in Wichita, Kansas.

His senior executive career began in working for his father, at their family-owned computer company, PC Designs, Inc. which became one of the largest suppliers of computer products to several state governments in the 1980’s to late 1990’s. Starting out as a “mail-order” computer catalog company, Freeman, as Executive Vice President, led the efforts to begin government bidding which became successful. During this time at PC Designs, Freeman also invented the Extndr® expandable EISA circuit board, much loved by government agencies, because it could be updated with a simple “plug-in” of advanced CPU and GPU cards from Intel and AMD, without having to replace the entire motherboard and all peripherals. Freeman also managed the purchasing and vendor relationship with Hamilton Avnet, their main parts supplier. Freeman also negotiated a coveted “Technology Sharing Agreement” with industry giant Intel, which became important in developing the FirstLook Video product and technology.

While at PC Designs, Freeman started an independent project and co-invented (along with his brother, father, and brother-in-law) the packeting protocol and product for real-time streaming mobile video technology. Called FirstLook® Video, this device garnered the team two Television Academy of Arts and Sciences Emmy Awards for cutting-edge technology which advancing television programming. FirstLook Video, was the portable system that sends real-time, full-color, full-motion video over cellular telephone networks, won Emmys in two TV news categories: “Best Spot News Coverage” and “Special Engineering Achievement.”

It was also during this time that Freeman convinced virtually all the cell companies that existed in the U.S. to “sponsor” a portion of the purchase price of the FirstLook® Video Mobile Steaming Video Systems for the television stations. By leveraging the desire for Cell Companies to prove how robust their systems were, with the desire to sell to more TV stations, Freeman negotiated and authored what is thought to be the first agreements which permitted the Cell Companies to have on-air credit during “hard news” segments (something very common today, but unheard of at the time).

Michael Freeman with his Emmy Awards and Video Patents

The FirstLook Video technologies and patents became the foundation for the IEEE 802.11(n) MIMO standards throughout the world and are still used today in 4G and 5G applications. The foundational Streaming-Video patents have been cited in other patent applications hundreds of times, including by Apple, Nokia, Canon, Hewlett-Packard and Panasonic, a few examples. Also, the FirstLook real-time streaming video was the first technology to combine the communication of cellular technologies with the intelligence of computers. Freeman is continuing his work today with new innovations which fall under the IEEE 802.11(a,y) technologies.

After a good run selling the FirstLook product throughout the mid to late 1990’s, the patents and technologies were purchased by Samsung and later asserted in the Apple vs. Samsung II litigation, in which Mr. Freeman testified. In the so-called “Apsung” litigation it was established by the expert witnesses that the Freeman’s team were the first to invent streaming mobile video, and Freeman was recognized and the first engineer to merge the communications of a cell phone with the intelligence of a computer – the forerunner of the modern “Smart Phone”.

Before his inventing career, and while still in high-school and then college, the United States District Court (N.D.OK.) selected Freeman to work for the Court in bankruptcy cases leading then to his presiding over many operating businesses seeking federal bankruptcy protection and/or reorganization. Freeman was appointed to operate companies in bankruptcy, such as: Real Estate Development, Oil and Gas Operations, Insurance Agencies, Commercial Retail Companies, Investment Ventures, Restaurants, Catering and Resorts, and other operating entities like a large Printing Company. Over more than a decade Freeman served as Operating Trustee in over 75 Operating Company bankruptcy cases.
His work typically resulted in the going concern portion of the Chapter 11 business being sold to a new group, often a VC group, while the debts stayed with the case to be administered by the Court.

Because of his exemplary service running companies and resolving cases, Freeman was selected in the mid 1980’s to be appointed by the U.S. Department of Justice to the new Congressionally created Office of the U.S. Trustee which oversaw bankruptcy cases and case trustees.

Shangri La 18 Hole Golf Resort in Grove, Oklahoma was one of Freeman's Business Bankruptcy Cases

As an Assistant United States Trustee (AUST), where he oversaw the bankruptcy process and the case trustees for an entire region. This experience provided Mr. Freeman with a next-level exposure to many business sectors, where he gained expertise including financing, mergers & acquisitions, operations, and marketing.

As AUST, Mr. Freeman also coordinated efforts with the United States Attorney’s Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to crack down on bankruptcy fraud and crimes. Both of these agencies honored Mr. Freeman with unique commendations for his “crime busting” efforts where Freeman’s own investigative work led to several large-scale criminal convictions.

Freeman also received a commendation from the IRS for pushing through cases which had stalled for years in Chapter 11 status, which resulted in over $11M of taxes being paid.

During his AUST tenure, Freeman also received a one-of-a-kind Special Commendation from all five of the then sitting Oklahoma Bankruptcy Judges, which was presented to the United State Congress for his exemplary AUST efforts (see, below).. The DOJ also bestowed on Freeman a special “Certificate of Appreciation” commendation for Freeman’s dedicated efforts and evaluated that his new AUST start-up office was “the most organized of any” in the U.S. Trustee program nationwide.

Freeman was also appointed by the Federal Court in the Western District of Oklahoma as a Special Master on an important case of international standing involving Texas Oil & Gas, Inc. where Freeman successfully presided over an international collection of creditors involving oil concessions in Egypt. Freeman supervised successful negotiations where disputes were resolved in the $500M case.

After his AUST stint, Freeman’ business reorganization efforts were also recognized by the Governor of the State of Louisiana, Buddy Roemer, who awarded Freeman with a Special Commendation and Award for Freeman’s “groundbreaking”” first-ever environmental “restart/workout” through an agreement between the Governor’s office, the Environmental Agencies, and a Special Legislative Taskforce. These efforts permitted a large pipe fitting manufacturing plant/foundry, in Opelousas, St. Landry Parish, which had been shut-down for environmental violations to be restarted which put over 400 locals back to work. Freeman served as Executive Vice President, while his father was the CEO and the acquiring party. It was deemed the first environmental “work out” in the State of Louisiana.

Working part-time in the legal arena in the 1990’s on a single case, Freeman led the efforts of what was called at the time the “largest state class action settlement” in Oklahoma involving the crash of several related bank and securities related financial institutions. The projected loss to the creditors was over $100M, however, thanks to the efforts of the Trustee who was appointed and the success of the Freeman-lead Class Action litigation, the creditors received almost an 70% recoupment. During this litigation, Freeman hired a team of C.P.A.’s to coach him to become an accounting expert and managed the multi-lawyer legal team that ultimately recovered a settlement for financial investors of $48 million (including a $35 million settlement from Peat, Marwick & Mitchell on claims of accounting defalcations similar to Arthur Anderson’s alleged failures in the Enron scandal).

Freeman also served a stint in the Major Motion Picture Industry in Hollywood as a Sr. Executive Vice President for a leading Film Product Company, 1492 Studios, Inc. which produced such movies as Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, and the first three Harry Potter films. 1492 Studios was founded by the number 9 all-time grossing Hollywood Director, Chris Columbus. Freeman’s last film with the team was the first Night at the Museum feature which was the first film to earn over $1 billion in 87 days.

After taking some time off to build a 1,200-acre ranch in Bixby, Oklahoma in the late 1990-2000’s, Freeman returned to inventing in 2012 founding a new semiconductor company called Semitrex Semiconductors (now Helix Semiconductors) and its subsidiaries, where Freeman developed the first break-through technology in power supplies in over 50 years. Freeman received over 30 patents for his new transformerless power-supply technology he invented and named Muxcapacitor® Power Supply System on a Chip (PSSoC) for AC/DC and DC/DC power supplies which provides over 90% efficiency with virtually no standby power requirements. This technology company is currently under contract for sale at $150M. More information about Freeman’s power supply innovations can be found a Wikipedia. See, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helix_Semiconductors

Freeman’s efforts today are focused on the commercialization of the Ocutrx Technologies products and adding to the 7 patents already garnered by Team Ocutrx in the AR/XR and 3D visualization field.

Upon Ocutrx receiving the patent on the Near-Eye Pupil-Forming Catadioptric Optical Engine, Pete Conley, Managing Director and Head of Intellectual Property (IP) Banking at Boustead Securities said, “Congratulations, Michael – this is a BIG DEAL!!” Mr. Conley further stated: “As you obviously know, optical engines are widely used in televisions, projectors, laser systems, scanners, industrial robots, etc.….optical engines are widely used in televisions, projectors, laser systems, scanners, industrial robots, etc. are widely patented. Not surprisingly, of the 8,131 issued “optical engine” patents worldwide (all jurisdictions) most are held by leading players in those global markets (Bosch, Coretronic, LG, Samsung, GE, etc.)…[A]s a subset of those optical engine patents “catadioptric optical systems” comprise 2,711 issued patents. The catadioptric systems are generally used in telephoto lenses, telescopes, microscopes, semiconductor photolithography, etc. Of these 2,711 issued patents worldwide are also held by leading players in those global markets (Zeiss, Nikon, Canon, KLA-Tencor, ASML, etc.). Utilizing PatSnap intelligence platform www.patsnap.com, I could find no issued patents in any jurisdiction utilizing catadioptric optical engines (other than yours) and no company utilizing these combined technologies in a wearable headset form factor with a plethora of use cases in AR/VR. Ocutrx is literally leading a new field of technology and it’s not surprising you’re blowing HoloLens out of the water. And lastly, developing your key enabling technology as an “engine” transforms your business model and is what made Qualcomm and ARM Holdings / Nvidia the companies they are today. Again, congratulations on pioneering a breakthrough technology!”

United States Federal Judiciary Commendation to Congress on the U.S. Trustee Program:

Issued for service 1987-1989

“For the last two years, Mr. Freeman, the Assistant U.S. Trustee, has done an outstanding job of carrying out the duties of his office. All the judges in this district have been extremely pleased with his work. Attorneys I’ve spoken to have been pleased and oftentimes amazed with his abilities in resolving and helping to resolve complicated cases. I’ve been here now for almost eight years, and I’ll have to say, with Mr. Freeman on the scene the last two years, the administration of the whole process has run more smoothly than I’ve ever seen it.”

Hon. Richard L. Bohanan Chief Bankruptcy Judge Western District of Oklahoma

United States Bankruptcy Court for the Norther District of Oklahoma

“I have observed the performance of Mr. Freeman as a Trustee in this District for a number of years and have appointed him as Trustee in cases in which the duties of the Trustee were almost impossible to accomplish, wherein the Trustee received little or no cooperation from the Debtors or was faced with a Debtor who had absented himself or itself, and/or a Debtor with little or no books and records concerning financial affairs. Mr. Freeman has succeeded in discharging the duties of the Trustee successfully, even to the extent of restructuring the books and records of an absentee Debtor. Further, by his personal attendance and involvement, he has taken possession of assets attempted to be secreted by Debtors. The results of all of the above have pleasantly surprised the Court.”

“I can think of numbers of instances where these tasks were assigned to Mr. Freeman and accomplished, and thus I was able to impose upon him to administer estates which were most troublesome and difficult. This is, of course, in addition to his regular assignment of “run of the mill” cases.” Mr. Freeman is held in the highest possible regard by this Court.”

Hon. Mickey D. Wilson

Mr. Freeman, at that time a high school student, began to work in the general area of bankruptcy and commercial law in assisting attorneys serving as trustees in a great variety of bankruptcy cases conduct investigations, marshaling and selling assets and performing the myriad tasks necessary to administration of bankruptcy estates. Since that time, I have observed his progress through undergraduate and legal education and the practice of law. After conclusion of his legal education, he has served in the capacity of trustee or as attorney for the estate in bankruptcy in cases more numerous than I can estimate.”

“Through this process, Mr. Freeman has acquired a complete experience and familiarity with all manner of bankruptcy cases and problems ranging from the simple through the complex; from no asset cases through those involving tens of millions in assets or debt; and in both liquidating and reorganization modes. Freeman has consistently performed honestly, efficiently, and with consideration to those affected by his actions.”
